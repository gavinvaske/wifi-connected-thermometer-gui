## Usage

1) clone this repository: 'git clone https://github.com/gvwarrior/wifi-connected-thermometer-gui.git'
2) Open project via an IDE (I Used Visual Studio Code, use whatever you're most comfortable with!)
3) Open a terminal window that points to the base directory ('/wifi-connected-thermometer-gui') and run the command 'npm install' to download all dependencies this project needs
4) To start server locally, in the same terminal window opened in step #3, run 'nodemon server.js' to start a webserver.
5) To check if your server started correctly, open a web browser and go to 'http://localhost:3000' (If you don't see anything, revisit steps 3 and 4)
